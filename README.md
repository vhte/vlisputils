# vlisputils

This repository is a collection of AutoLISP functionalities for programmers. The following avaiable implementations are useful to aid development process along AutoCAD and all its interactions with Visual LISP Editor. Currently using **AutoCAD 2017** to code testing.

The following implementations are in the schedule: 

- **DCL Cheat Sheet**: A complete example of DCL functionalities and common actions with its properties;
- ~~**Coordinate System Properties**~~: How to change coordinate systems and make them interact with each other;
- ~~**Angle Operations**~~: Rotate objects and calculate angles between dependent objects;
- ~~**File Operations**~~: Wide view across file operations in LISP. RWD, filters and text searching;
- **VLX Operations and Application Lockdown**~~: Create separate namespace to the application, how to interact with drawing namespace and code security;
- ~~**System Access, Variables and Administration**~~: Get access to devices, user system information, registry keys and computer administration;
- ~~**External Processing of Heavy Data**~~: Enabling AutoCAD run heavy data processment outside user's computer. When result is calculated, finish routine with output data;
