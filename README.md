# vlisputils

This repository is a collection of AutoLISP functionalities for developers. The following avaiable implementations are useful to aid development process along AutoCAD and all its interactions with Visual LISP Editor. This project is tested in **AutoCAD 2017** and kern VLLib: IDE v.T* Mar 03 1999, build #692 [2/6/16].

The following implementations are in the schedule: 

- **DCL Cheat Sheet**: A complete example of DCL functionalities and common actions with its elements;
- ~~**Coordinate System Properties**~~: How to change coordinate systems and make them interact with each other;
- ~~**Angle Operations**~~: Rotate objects and calculate angles between dependent objects;
- ~~**File Operations**~~: Wide view across file operations in LISP. RWD, filters and text searching;
- **VLX Operations and Application Lockdown**: Create separate namespace to the application, how to interact with drawing namespace and code security;
- **System Access, Variables and Administration**: Get access to devices, user system information, registry keys and computer administration;
- **Error Report**: Using AutoCAD's Javascript library, send some data to a server when an error is thrown;
- ~~**Reactors**~~: How to catch callback events from AutoCAD;
- ~~**External Processing of Heavy Data**~~: Enable AutoCAD to run an external program by transfering huge amounts of data. When result is calculated, finish routine with output data;
